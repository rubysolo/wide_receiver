# Wide Receiver

Wide Receiver is a work queue system in which the worker classes decide which
messages to process.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'wide_receiver'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wide_receiver

## Usage

Create a worker class that extends `WideReceiver::Worker` and specifies which channel
patterns it wants to process:

```ruby
class Rice
  extend WideReceiver::Worker
  listen 'montana.pass.*'

  def perform(channel, message)
    # do something with message
  end
end
```

Start the master process:

```shell
bundle exec wide_receiver config/wide_receiver.rb
```

This will start one thread per unique channel pattern.  When a message is
received on a matching channel, each worker class that expressed interest in
that pattern will be instantiated, and the instance will receive the message.

The config file should set the queue_url, (optionally) the message format, and
require all your worker classes.  Here's an example config file from a Rails
project:

```ruby
require_relative 'environment'

WideReceiver::Config.instance.queue_url = Redis.current.id
WideReceiver::Config.instance.message_format = :json

Dir[Rails.root.join('app/workers/wide_receiver/*.rb')].each do |worker|
  require worker
end
```

Alternatively, you can setup RabbitMQ support using the following configuration:

```ruby
require_relative 'environment'

WideReceiver::Config.instance.queue_url      = "amqp://localhost:5672"
WideReceiver::Config.instance.message_format = :json
WideReceiver::Config.instance.options        = {
  exchange: {
    topic: 'montana'
  },
  queue: {
    auto_delete: true
  }
}
Dir[Rails.root.join('app/workers/wide_receiver/*.rb')].each do |worker|
  require worker
end
```
